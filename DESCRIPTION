Description: MetaboSPAN is a network method for pathway/chemical enrichment analysis of a list of metabolites/lipids of interest that tests the chemical space captured in an experiment, rather than a specific list of metabolites. In our method, metabolites/lipids that share pathway annotations with the set of interest are overlaid on a knowledge graph built from shared annotations in the RaMP 2.0 database. Relevant subnetworks are extracted based on graph topology analysis for enrichment analysis using the Fisherâ€™s exact test.
